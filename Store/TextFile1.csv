000004 | Bowtruckle | "Measuring up at a maximum height of 8 inches, the adorable Bowtruckle is so miniscule he can fit in your pocket (and will probably not want to leave once he is there). Their size makes them difficult to locate, so theycan get on nicely with their job of protecting wand wood trees." | 299
000005 | Fwooper | "The Fwooper may be petite, but is rather noicy in all senses of the word. Adorned in vivid plumage, this African bird comes in a variety of bright, flamboyant colours, and sings a song that can drive the listener insane." |700
000006 | Niffler | "You'd have to be a modest size to do the job a Niffler does, seing as the little critters spend a lot of their timeburrowing underground in their everlasting hunt for treasure." | 2
000007 | Mooncalf | "The adorable Mooncalf is tiny of body but rather big of bulging eyes that pop out of their head. Despite theit spindly legs and diminutive stature, don't take these guys for granted. After one of their special moonlight dances, their dung is extremly valuble." | 2016
000008 | Demiguise | "The Demiguise is relatively small for an ape-type creature, but seeing as they have the power to turn invisible within an instant, they're rater subtle for folks anyway." | 500
000009 | Graphorn | "The magnificent Graphorns are significally large, certanly big enough for mountain trolls to ride them. As well as their impressive size, Graphorns are marvellously adept at defending themselfs, with a hide tougher than a dragon's." | 600
000010 | Swooping Evil | "Although extremly vast, a Swooping Evil can easily be scooped up into a tioy cocoon at will. Immense, brightly coloured and almost butterfly-like in nature, the fact that they are also compact is extremely useful." | 3
000011 | Thunderbird | "There's no missing the Thunderbird. This enourmus flying creature is so huge and powerful it can create strorms as i flies. It is known to be larger than a human man when fully-grown, so don't get on the wrong side of it." | 3000
000012 | Erumpent | "Easily mistaken for rhinoceros, it's fair to say the Erumpent is more than just a little big-boned. These creatures can weigh up to a ton, and are famously known for their majestic horns, which explode upon impact. In other words: don't let one loose in a china shop. Or a balloon shop. Or anywhere, really." | 49
000013 | Runespoor | "Ever feel like you stick out from the crowd? Then feel for the poor old runespoor, a huge African serpent-like creature that can reach up to six or seven feet in length. In fact, the Runespoor is pretty noticeable for a number of reasons: on top of its distinctive orange and black strips, it also happens to have three heads." | 9001
